<h2 id="1-map-projections-video">1) Map Projections Video</h2>

<p>Watch the video discussing map projections for a quick overview of why they are important.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describe the practice of redlining in your own words</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-arcgis-pro-tutorial">2) ArcGIS Pro Tutorial</h2>

<p>Work through some tutorial materials put together by ESRI to gain some familiarity with using ArcGIS Pro.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete the ArcGIS Pro Tutorial to make your first map!</li>
  <li>Then watch a few videos to gain familiarity with some other aspects of the application.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-foundations-of-epidemiology">3) Foundations of Epidemiology</h2>

<p>You will recreate an example from history using modern geospatial analysis methods.  Dr. John Snow was the first person to prove that Cholera was a waterborne pathogen.  He used manual surveying, a paper map, and rudimentary geospatial analysis to identify a well as the source of a Cholera out break in London.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will apply a modern method known as <a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/2.8/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/kernel-density.htm">kernel density</a> to recreate this analysis and see if you can find the well that caused the outbreak.</li>
</ul>
