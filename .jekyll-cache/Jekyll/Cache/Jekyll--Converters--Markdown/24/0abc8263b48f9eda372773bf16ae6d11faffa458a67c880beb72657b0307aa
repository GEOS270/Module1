<h2 id="what-is-giscience">What is GIScience?</h2>

<p>The science and study of geospatial information: GIScience is a framework we use to understand spatial information.  It is rooted in Cartography, the art and science of graphically mapping but it is inherently multidisciplinary and drawing on Computer Science, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Remote Sensing, and many other fields.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-gisystem">What is a GISystem?</h2>

<p>Any system or tool we use to store and analyze geospatial information can broadly be considered a GISystem.
