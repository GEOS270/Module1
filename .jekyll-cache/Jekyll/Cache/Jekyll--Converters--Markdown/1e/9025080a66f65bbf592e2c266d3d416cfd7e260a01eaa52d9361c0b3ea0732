<strong>__</strong> is a measure of angular distance North/South of the equator and <strong>__</strong> is a measure of angular distance from the prime meridian.  Together, they form a <strong>__</strong>, describing locations on the surface of a simplified model of the earth known as a <strong>__</strong> which represents the earth as an oblate spheroid.</p>
