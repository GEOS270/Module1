Before we get into the doing the analysis, lets get some context behind why this is important. **Note** This section covers **[question 7](Assessment.md#foundations-of-epidemiology)** in the module quiz --- {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- # Miasma vs. Germ Theory Early forms of [germ theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease), the concept that disease transmission is driven by pathogens, emerged around the world more than 2000 years ago. By the middle ages, Islamic physicians had formally proposed the basics of germ theory. For example, writing about an outbreak of the bubonic plague in [1362](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Khatib#On_the_Plague), Ibn al-Khatib astutely pointed out: * *\"The existence of contagion is established by experience [and] by trustworthy reports on transmission by garments, vessels, ear-rings; by the spread of it by persons from one house, by infection of a healthy sea-port by an arrival from an infected land [and] by the immunity of isolated individuals.\"* Yet European physicians clung to the [miasma theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory) for many centuries. This theory attributed diseases such as cholera to “bad air”. ## Hand Washing: An Early Case Study {: .no_toc } The Vienna Maternity Hospital had two clinics with vastly different maternal mortality rates. Between 1840 and 1846, the maternal mortality rate was 10% at the \"First\" clinic but only 4% at the \"Second\" clinic run by midwives. * The First clinic was run by physicians and medical students. * They started each day with postmortem examinations. They then proceeded to the maternity, **ward without washing their hands**, where the students did vaginal examinations as part of their training (Loudon, 2013). * The Second clinic was run by midwives. * They generally had more sanitary practices (Varney & Thompson 2015) and they did not do postmortems or vaginal examinations (Loudon, 2013). * Consequently they tended to have lower mortality rates. In 1847, the new chief resident Ignaz Semmelweis suspected contagions from the cadavers were to blame. Semmelweis mandated hand washing and sanitizing instruments with a chlorine solution for both clinics. * By 1848, the maternal mortality rate in both clinics fell to 1.3% (Loudon, 2013). * Despite the overwhelming evidence in favor of sanitizing, the practice was rejected by the European medical community because it was in conflict with the Miasma theory. * Semmelweis' was replaced in 1849, sanitizing fell out of practice, and death rates began to rise again. View Image in New Tab # Belief Perseverance In the face of mounting evidence many doctors and public officials stubbornly refused to acknowledge that basic hygiene and sanitation could save lives for decades because they were attached to the Miasma theory. * Some were also offended by the idea that physicians themselves were vectors for disease transmission because [*\"a gentleman's hands are clean\"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Delucena_Meigs). Rejection of sanitary practices in the European medical community is an example of [belief perseverance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_perseverance). Historically, this is a common issue that has impeded numerous scientific advancements (eg. plate tectonics, climate change, vaccines, etc). * Belief perseverance has many causes but it is often exacerbated by misogyny, racism, and ethnocentrism (eg. Rossiter 1993). # Foundations of Epidemiology [Dr. John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow#Cholera) was a physician practicing in London where cholera outbreaks were a frequent occurrence due to poor sanitation practices. Dr. Snow was a skeptic of the miasma theory and a proponent of germ theory. * In 1849 he proposed cholera that it was spread by fecal contaminated water, after comparing cholera rates between London districts supplied by different water companies. Five years later, during an outbreak in London's SoHo neighborhood in 1854, Dr. Snow was able to identify the point source of an the outbreak using a hand-sketched map. * He recorded each case of cholera in the area using a dash, and recorded each water pump with a circled dot, creating what today would be called a **dot map**. * By recording clusters of disease, and conducting interviews, Snow was able to trace most cases of the outbreak to a single water pump, located on Broad st. Using his map, Dr. Snow was able to convince the local council to remove the pump handle and the outbreak subsided. * Despite this, the medical community in London continued to reject the idea that Cholera was caused by fecal contamination for another twenty years.

TOC {:toc} --- # Georeferencing In order to get a historical map into a GIS, it has to be scanned and then [georeferenced](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/imagery/overview-of-georeferencing.htm). To georeference a map like, locations on the scanned image (eg. intersections) can be matched up to known reference points. * With enough matching points (>=3), an accurate transformation can be calculated and the paper map can be referenced to the proper location. I've done this for you to save some time. * Watch the video linked below for a quick overview of georeferencing. Once a map has been georeferenced, we can extract information from it. On Dr. Snow’s map, the key pieces of information are the cholera deaths and water pumps. To get this information into the GIS, the points have to be manually identified and entered. This process is known as digitizing, and was explained in the [Create points on a map](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/create-points-on-a-map.htm) video. We'll get some practice digitizing in a bit. --- # Adding the Deaths feature dataset. The cholera deaths have already been digitized.

TOC {:toc} --- # Central Tendency There are numerous ways to analyze the spatial distribution of a dataset. The [Mean Center](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/mean-center.htm) and [Directional Distribution](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/directional-distribution.htm) are two of the simplest measures. Mean center gives you a single point around which the directional distribution creates an ellipse to show directional trends in the data. You don't have to calculate these statistics, but skim the linked pages and look at the example below to understand what these methods do. * They can be weighted (eg. by the number of deaths per address). * These measures roughly identify the Broad St. Pump as the source of the outbreak, as shown in the figure below. * However, they are rudimentary metrics at best. They could be used to identify multiple point sources for example. View Image in New Tab --- # Kernel Density A more advanced method is [Kernel Density](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/kernel-density.htm), which gives you a magnitude (eg. number of deaths) per unit area (eg. hectare).

    "content": "# What is GIS? The **GI** stands for **Geographic Information**. The **S** can be either **Science** or **System**. You will often see them used interchangeably because they are very closely related. Basically, you do GI*Science* with a GI*System*. ## What is GIScience? The science and study of geospatial information: GIScience is a framework we use to understand spatial information. It is rooted in Cartography, the art and science of graphically mapping but it is inherently multidisciplinary and drawing on Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, Remote Sensing, and many other fields. ## What is a GISystem? Any system or tool we use to store and analyze geospatial information can broadly be considered a GISystem. Until a the late 20th century, atlases and library map catalogues were our most advanced GIS. Now we have a wide range of computer and web based GISystems. Ranging from the \"desktop\" GIS applications like ArcGIS Pro that you will be using to cloud computing systems that can Terabytes of planetary scale data. ## What can be done with GIS? GIS can be used to help solve a wide range of geographic problems in different fields: * Epidemiology/Public Health * Planning (Urban, Hazards) * Conservation & Resource Management * Economics * Epidemiology * Climate Science * Ecology/Biology * Social Justice --- # TopHat Question 1 GIS is an acronym that stands for: - Geographic Information Science - Geographic Information System - Both Geographic Information Science and Geographic Information System ",

TOC {:toc} --- # Proprietary GIS Software GIS is very much rooted in capitalism and the capitalist enterprise. Consequently many of the initial developments in GIS were by for profit companies. For example, [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) is a leading producer of GIS software. They make ArcGIS Pro, the software package we will be working with most in this class. **Proprietary** software requires users to purchase a license in order to gain access and restricts access to source code, meaning users have no right to view or edit source code (inner workings of a program). Common examples of proprietary technology include: * Operating Systems: Windows OS, Mac OS, IOS * Programming Languages: MATLAB, VBScript * Software Packages: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Power Point etc.), Adobe Illustrator, IOS, ArcMap Proprietary software licenses are often very expensive. They pose a significant barrier to access for uses that aren't affiliated with large institutions. ## ArcGIS Pro {: .no_toc } --- # Open Source GIS There are alternatives! Open source software packages have proliferated in recent years and are a viable alternative to the traditional options. The the internet has connected like-minded developers and allowed for collaboration across the globe. **Open Source** software is free to use, published under an open copyright license. Users have the right to view, edit, and distribute the source code. Common examples of open source technology include: * Operating Systems: Linux OS, Android * Programming Languages: Python, R, Java, etc. * Software Packages: Libre Office (Writer, Calc, Impress, etc.), Ink Scape, QGIS Open source software is more accessible because its free to download and use. ## QGIS {: .no_toc } Your browser does not support iframes.
