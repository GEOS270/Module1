# History of GIS

A holistic understanding of GIS can help you use it effectively **and** responsibly.  A good way to start off is to look at the history of the GIS and Cartography more broadly.

* In this section of the module, I will give a sweeping overview of the development of the discipline.
  * We'll start with the very first maps and end with the widespread adoption of GIS and proliferation of geospatail technology.
