# Lab Assignment

This lab has 3 parts to it.

## 1) Redlining video

Watch the video discussing redlining to learn about a key example of the misuse of GIS from history.

* dDescribe the practice of redlining in your own words

## 2) ArcGIS Pro Tutorial

Work through some tutorial materials put together by ESRI to gain some familiarity with using ArcGIS Pro.  

* Complete the ArcGIS Pro Tutorial to make your first map!
* Then watch a few videos to gain familiarity with some other aspects of the application.


## 3) Foundations of Epidemiology

You will recreate an example from history using modern geospatial analysis methods.  Dr. John Snow was the first person to prove that Cholera was a waterborne pathogen.  He used manual surveying, a paper map, and rudimentary geospatial analysis to identify a well as the source of a Cholera out break in London.

* You will apply a modern method known as [kernel density](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/2.8/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/kernel-density.htm) to recreate this analysis and see if you can find the well that caused the outbreak.
